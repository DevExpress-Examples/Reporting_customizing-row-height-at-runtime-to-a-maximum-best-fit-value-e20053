# Customizing row height at runtime to a maximum best fit value


<p>This example demonstrates how to set XRTable.Height at runtime for all generated details to the best-fit value given by the maximum row height. Here, each data row is represented by an XRTable object but the approach is easily generalizable to any data-bound XRControl (e.g. XRLabel).</p>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>CreateCustomDocument calls CreateDocument twice. On the second pass, row heights are set appropriately.</p>
